UVA CS Dissertation Template Version 0.22

This distribution contains a skeleton LaTeX document for a
dissertation. It's based on changes to the book.cls style file
(mybook.cls) which go back at least 10 years.

Feel free to improve this distribution and pass it on. Credits and
changelog are at the bottom of this file.


ACQUISITION

You can find the latest version of this distribution at
http://www.coppit.org/code/index.html

Get tex4ht at http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html
(Be sure to get Apr 24 2001 or newer. You may also have to get updated
files from the bugfixes link.)


DIRECTORIES

- bin: contains latexmk for building latex documents. fixbb for fixing
  the bounding box of EPS figures. wwwis for updating IMG size
  attributes in HTML. 
- figures: EPS figures. PDF versions are also stored here after being
  automatically created for pdflatex in the makefile. NOTE: generating
  PDF figures from EPS figures with anything other than distiller is
  not recommended, as tools like epstopdf don't compute the bounding
  box correctly, or do funny things to fonts or lines. I ended up
  doing the following:
  - Use PDFWriter printer to create a PDF.
  - Use Acrobat (not reader) to crop the page
  - Since Acrobat 5 insists on outputting PDF 4, and latexpdf can only
    handle PDF 3, you have to save the cropped figure as EPS. (Plus
    you might want an EPS version.)
  - Run the figure through distiller to convert the EPS to PDF
- misc: Miscellaneous dissertation-related stuff
- output: Intermediate and output files go here. (With the exception
  of the PDF figures in the figures directory)
- source: all the .tex and .bib files
- styles: style files
- build: intermediate files


SOURCE FILES

dissertation-www.tex: The dissertation formatted for HTML output
dissertation.tex: The top-level file, with some control options
body.tex: The "meat" of the document. Has includes for the chapters
texstuff.tex: useful LaTeX definitions
refs.bib: replace with your own BiBTeX bibliography

Other files should be self-explanatory.


FEATURES

For your LaTeX enjoyment:

- 1.67 spacing for title and copyright pages. Also for rest of
  document unless single is true
- single boolean: set to true for single spacing
- tth boolean: set to true if processing with tth
- ht boolean: set to true if processing with ht
- draft boolean: set to true for draft copy
- \qedsymbol: a black square for the end of proofs
- \ifwww: allows you to tweak things for HTML output
- figurecodeverbatim environment: for formatting code in figures
- quotecodeverbatim environment: for formatting code in main text
- fancyfigure: an environment for text figures (puts a line above and
  below the figure to help offset it from the main text)
- Ventry: an environment for terms and definitions, where the width
  of the left column of terms is auto-computed.

  [This isn't based directly on this template, but uses the same style
  and html output strategy.]


STANDARDS

The style file is believed to be fully compliant with the UVA thesis
style requirements:
- http://www.cs.virginia.edu/graduate/G122.pdf


INSTALLATION

- You may have to fix the #! line for the scripts in bin.
- You may have to adjust the paths to the programs in the makefile.
- On the UVa CS department servers, the teTeX distribution in
  /usr/cs/teTeX is not quite new enough.  Until systems staff upgrades
  it, you can use the one in ~dwc3q/teTeX. The makefile paths reflect
  this.
- There are a number of latex styles that you will need: fancyvrb,
  cite, url, pslatex, setspace. Most likely these are already
  installed.
- Images in HTML output can be tricky. It depends on the size of the
  image that you specify in your latex document, the "density" of the
  gif image created from the eps file, and any scaling you might do.
  The file misc/tex4ht.env contains commands and comments describing
  some different options.


MAKEFILE

The makefile is set up to use pdflatex to generate PDF, and latex to
generate DVI, PS, and HTML. See the documentation in the makefiles for
descriptions of make targets.

These makefiles were written for GNU make (may be called "make" or
"gmake" on your system). If you don't have GNU make, you may want to
try modifying the makefiles to work with your version of make. Change:

  TEXFILES = $(shell ls source/*.tex)
  DISTFILE = $(shell date +issre2001-%Y-%m-%d)
  EPSFIGFILES = $(shell ls figures/*.eps)

to:

  TEXFILES:sh = ls source/*.tex
  DISTFILE:sh = date +issre2001-%Y-%m-%d
  EPSFIGFILES:sh = ls figures/*.eps

your mileage may vary.


HTML OUTPUT

The makefile uses tex4ht to create the output. The misc directory
includes a modified tex4ht.env which should produce better images.

TODO

- Find a good, free method of generating pdf figures from eps figures
  (distiller is the only method I know of which computes the right
  bounding box.)
