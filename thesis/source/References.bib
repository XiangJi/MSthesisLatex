  abstract={Scientific innovation continues to increase requirements for the computing and networking infrastructures of the world. Collaborative partners, instrumentation, storage, and processing facilities are often geographically and topologically separated, as is the case with LHC virtual organizations. These separations challenge the technology used to interconnect available resources, often delivered by Research and Education (R&E) networking providers, and leads to complications in the overall process of end-to-end data management. Capacity and traffic management are key concerns of R&E network operators; a delicate balance is required to serve both long-lived, high capacity network flows, as well as more traditional end-user activities. The advent of dynamic circuit services, a technology that enables the creation of variable duration, guaranteed bandwidth networking channels, allows for the efficient use of common network infrastructures. These gains are seen particularly in locations where overall capacity is scarce compared to the (sustained peak) needs of user communities. Related efforts, including those of the LHCOPN [3] operations group and the emerging LHCONE [4] project, may take advantage of available resources by designating specific network activities as a â€œhigh priorityâ€? allowing reservation of dedicated bandwidth or optimizing for deadline scheduling and predicable delivery patterns. This paper presents the DYNES instrument, an NSF funded cyberinfrastructure project designed to facilitate end-to-end dynamic circuit services [2]. This combination of hardware and software innovation is being deployed across R&E networks in the United States at selected end-sites located on University Campuses. DYNES is peering with international efforts in other countries using similar solutions, and is increasing the reach of this emerging technology. This global data movement solution could be integrated into computing paradigms such as cloud and grid computing platforms, and through the use of APIs can be integrated into existing data movement software.}

  abstract={Scientific innovation continues to increase requirements for the computing and networking infrastructures of the world. Collaborative partners, instrumentation, storage, and processing facilities are often geographically and topologically separated, as is the case with LHC virtual organizations. These separations challenge the technology used to interconnect available resources, often delivered by Research and Education (R&E) networking providers, and leads to complications in the overall process of end-to-end data management. Capacity and traffic management are key concerns of R&E network operators; a delicate balance is required to serve both long-lived, high capacity network flows, as well as more traditional end-user activities. The advent of dynamic circuit services, a technology that enables the creation of variable duration, guaranteed bandwidth networking channels, allows for the efficient use of common network infrastructures. These gains are seen particularly in locations where overall capacity is scarce compared to the (sustained peak) needs of user communities. Related efforts, including those of the LHCOPN [3] operations group and the emerging LHCONE [4] project, may take advantage of available resources by designating specific network activities as a ¡°high priority¡±, allowing reservation of dedicated bandwidth or optimizing for deadline scheduling and predicable delivery patterns. This paper presents the DYNES instrument, an NSF funded cyberinfrastructure project designed to facilitate end-to-end dynamic circuit services [2]. This combination of hardware and software innovation is being deployed across R&E networks in the United States at selected end-sites located on University Campuses. DYNES is peering with international efforts in other countries using similar solutions, and is increasing the reach of this emerging technology. This global data movement solution could be integrated into computing paradigms such as cloud and grid computing platforms, and through the use of APIs can be integrated into existing data movement software.}

% An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
% settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
% before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
% (just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
% in the bibliography.)
% The available control fields are:
%
% CTLuse_article_number
% "no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
% "yes" enables
%
% CTLuse_paper
% "no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
% "yes" enables
%
% CTLuse_forced_etal
% "no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
% "yes" enables
%
% CTLmax_names_forced_etal
% The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
% usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
% is not greater than this value!
%
% CTLnames_show_etal
% The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
% Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal
%
% CTLuse_alt_spacing
% "no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
% "yes" enables
%
% CTLalt_stretch_factor
% If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
% the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
% default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
% stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.
%
% CTLdash_repeated_names
% "no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
% of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
% "yes" enables
%
% CTLname_format_string
% The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
% guide.
% IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,
%
% CTL_name_latex_cmd
% A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
% Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
% The default is empty.
%
% Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out or empty.
