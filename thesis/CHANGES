Version 0.23: Sat Nov 22 10:52:59 EST 2003
- Separated the changelog from the readme.
- Renamed the makefile to GNUmakefile

Version 0.22: Thu Jan 23 23:32:36 EST 2003
- Incorporated John Regehr's Tex4HT configuration file to increase TeX's
  capacity. (Thanks to Nicolas Christin <nicolas@cs.Virginia.EDU> for
  suggesting this change, and patching the Makefile to take advantage of it.)

Version 0.21: Tue Aug 20 22:11:34 EDT 2002
- Added a couple LaTeX features
- Temp directory name is now randomly generated
- The date on the title page and signature page is now *not*
  generated. (Depends on when you officially graduate.)
- I'm done with my dissertation (woohoo!), so future updates will
  likely come from other people.
- All figures are copied now, since people may manually create pdf
  versions

Version 0.20:
- Oops. Forgot to do changelog. :( I think:
- Added hyperref package for hyperlinks in PDF

Version 0.10: Tue Apr 24 17:50:53 EDT 2001
- Created by David Coppit (http://coppit.org/) based on John Regehr's
  (http://regehr.org/john/) dissertation.
- Fixed a bug in latexmk and submitted a patch. (The version in bin is
  not "official".)
